# The Journalism Library (web scraping functions)

A collection of TypeScript functions for journalistic projects. This library
focuses on functions that easily download data or files from the web. It's part
of the [journalism library](https://github.com/nshiab/journalism).

The library is available on
[JSR](https://jsr.io/@nshiab/journalism-web-scraping) with its
[documentation](https://jsr.io/@nshiab/journalism-web-scraping/doc).

The documentation is also available as the markdown file
[llm.md](https://github.com/nshiab/journalism-web-scraping/blob/main/llm.md),
which can be passed as context to improve the use of the library by AI coding
assistants or agents.

The library is maintained by [Nael Shiab](http://naelshiab.com/), computational
journalist and senior data producer for [CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news).
